    Step1: Go to the official website of MySQL and download the community server edition software. Here, you will see the option to choose the Operating System, such as Windows.

{

    Step 2:  In the next wizard, choose the Setup Type. There are several types available, and you need to choose the appropriate option to install MySQL product and features. Here, we are going to select the Full option and click on the Next button.

}

{

    Step 3:  Once we click on the Next button, it may give information about some features that may fail to install on your system due to a lack of requirements. We can resolve them by clicking on the Execute button that will install all requirements automatically or can skip them. Now, click on the Next button.

{

    Step 4 : In the next wizard, we will see a dialog box that asks for our confirmation of a few products not getting installed. Here, we have to click on the Yes button.

    Step 6:  In the next wizard, we need to configure the MySQL Server and Router. Here, I am not going to configure the Router because there is no need to use it with MySQL. We are going to show you how to configure the server only. Now, click on the Next button.
}

    Step 7: As soon as you will click on the Next button, you can see the screen below. Here, we have to configure the MySQL Server. Now, choose the Standalone MySQL Server/Classic MySQL Replication option and click on Next. Here, you can also choose the InnoDB Cluster based on your needs.

    Step 8 : In the next screen, the system will ask you to choose the Config Type and other connectivity options. Here, we are going to select the Config Type as 'Development Machine' and Connectivity as TCP/IP, and Port Number is 3306, then click on Next.

{

     Step 9: Now, select the Authentication Method and click on Next. Here, I am going to select the first option.

    Step 10: The next screen will ask you to mention the MySQL Root Password. After filling the password details, click on the Next button.
    
    Step 11: The next screen will ask you to configure the Windows Service to start the server. Keep the default setup and click on the Next button.
